- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon Torres
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing (mostly Azure and IBM cloud) and systems programming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop within the cloud. Doing so will teach me how to maintain a large enterprise application.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can as I'm still looking to gain experience.
